## Abstract
The multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) is widely applicable in various fields. 
Motivated by several practical applications, this work investigates a new variant of MCKP, called data-driven chance-constrained multiple-choice knapsack problem (DDCCMCKP). 
The problem is formulated and two sets of benchmarks are proposed.
In these two sets of benchmarks, one set simulates a simple scenario, while the other is devised to simulate a more complex situation from a real business scenario of a certain telecommunication company.
To solve this problem, a data-driven adapted local search algorithm is proposed.
The most merit of the proposed algorithm remains in evaluating solutions with chance constraints by data-driven methods, under the condition of unknown distributions and only historical sample data being available.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it is superior to other baselines. 
Ablation experiments also confirm the necessity of each component in the algorithm.
Our novel algorithm can serve as a new baseline, and the code and benchmark sets will be open-sourced to further promote research on DDCCMCKP.
